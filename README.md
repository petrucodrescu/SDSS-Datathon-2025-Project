# SDSS-Datathon-2025-Project
This project was our final submission to the 2025 SDSS Datathon hosted at Uoft. 
Our analysis was centered around delayed subway arrivals and their relationships with stations and days of the week.
Culminated in the creation of a neural network model that predicted the delay time of a subway in minutes using the station and day of the week.
Other statistical analyses are included within the project to be read by those interested.


Collaborators include: Andre Sanchez-Plehn, Julia Tan, and Sean Chua
